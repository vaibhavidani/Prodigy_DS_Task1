Creating a Bar or Histogram Visualization You can use this code to create a bar or histogram visualization of the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable in your population dataset. For example, you can visualize the distribution of ages or gender in the population.

Laptop Price Analysis

This repository contains Python code to analyze laptop prices using Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The code groups laptops by brand, calculates the average price for each brand, and then visualizes the top 10 brands with the highest average prices in a bar chart also perform additional visualisation tasks.

Introduction

Analysis & grouping laptops by brand, calculating the average price for each brand, visualizing the top 10 brands with the highest average prices, and additional visualization tasks like generating a distribution plot showing the distribution of specification ratings across all laptops in the dataset.

Pre-requisites

Before running the analysis, ensure you have Python installed on your machine along with the necessary libraries specified in the ipynb file.

Getting Started
1. Data Preparation
Ensure you have the relevant laptop data in a dataset (e.g., "data.csv" here) located in the same directory as your script.
2.Running the Script
Open a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).
Copy and paste the provided code for creating a bar chart visualization into your Python environment.
3.Executing the Visualization
Run the script.
The code will load the data, process it, and create a bar chart representing the top 10 brands with the highest average prices in the dataset.

Usage

Use this project to:
Gain insights into the price distribution of a different laptop brands.
Visualise top 10 brands with highest average prices and distribution of specification ratings across all laptops in the dataset.

Example

Here's how the bar chart might look:
